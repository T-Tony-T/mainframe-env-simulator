RULES
-------------------------
1)  A major mode have to be named as "modename.py", where "modename"
    is the name of the major mode with lowercase letters only.

2)  The mode file need to be placed in either the config folder
    (usually ~/.zPE/) or the system major mode folder
    (installation_path/zPE/UI/zMajorMode/) in order to be loaded.
    The former take preference.

3)  If the name of the major mode is "test.py", it have to define
    a class called "TestMode", which have to be derived from
    "zPE.UI.basemode.BaseMode" class.
    Any module in the two pathes without defining such a class will
    be ignored silently.
    Any module in the the pathes derives such a class not from
    "zPE.UI.basemode.BaseMode" class will cause a warning message.

4)  A major mode can override any methods defined in the BaseMode,
    but newly defined methods and members will not be seen outside
    the derived class.
