This project is to create a Mainframe Programming Environment Simulator running on PC (Linux, Max OS, Windows, etc.) that will compile / assemble source code written to be compiled / assembled on a Mainframe machine. The final goal is to let the developer work on their own PC when developing / testing their programs without worrying about internet connection or connection to a Mainframe machine. It is also aimed at reduce the teaching cost of IBM Assembler, COBOL, etc.
