GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------------
This software is a Mainframe Programming Environment Simulator
running on PC (Linux, Max OS, Windows, etc.) that will
compile / assemble source code written to be compiled / assembled
on a Mainframe machine.

The final goal is to let the developer work on their own PC when
developing / testing their programs without worrying about internet
connection or connection to a Mainframe machine. It is also aimed
at reduce the teaching cost of IBM Assembler, COBOL, etc.
